## Problem Statement ?

Currently gas fees on evmos are paid with (xxxx). For experienced users this may not be a problem, since they have learned to keep a reserve. For new users they  might not consider this requirment and therefore might get stuck on chain.

## Scenario ?

A new user recently bridged to EVMOS and does not have the gas fee to initially move out funds, he reached out to one of the relayers to fund the Gas Fees.

## What is Maulreen ?
 
 Maulreen is a low-cost hub of token meta-transaction relayers, **but it's also so much more than that**.
